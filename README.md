# uEssentialsAntiTracker
Blocks uEssential's player tracker analytics. 

Normally, uEssentials tracks whenever a player joins a server running uEssentials, including their SteamID. This data could be used to track what servers you play on across any server that runs uEssentials.
This plugin blocks these analytics, and requires no setup or configuration.
